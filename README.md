# Shadowdark
This is a repository for programs related to Shadowdark RPG

Shadowdark_level_0.exe is a program (made in python) to generate a 0-level character for Shadowdark. It creates a .txt file and then saves it in the same directory as the program. This program may only run with Windows. Please let me know if you know how to make it compatible with other systems.

Shadowdark_level_0.py is the python file used to create the application.

You are free to use these files however you wish. These files are experimental and neither I nor GitHub is responsible e for any damage their use may cause.
